# SudokuSolver

This is an app that solves Sudoku puzzles.
You can fill it up with (almost) any Sudoku puzzle and the app will fill up the rest of the numbers.

# Why I made this project

I've been learning android app development but I got bored from never doing my own projects.

I started solving sudoku for a while when i couldn't sleep.
I figured there was a way I could create a simple algorithm to solve this puzzles and I did.
In 2 days i got it working even though i don't have that much experience.
I know that i could probably search for this kind of algorithms but I created it from scratch as i wanted to try making something my own

# It's not ready

The code is a bit messy for now and lacks comments.
I also need to fix the visual design, UI and UX as i just wanted to see it work for a start.

# Let's talk

Feel free to contact me if you want to understand how i did it.
